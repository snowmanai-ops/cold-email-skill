## Standard

_Default for most cold emails. Simple, direct, proven._

Formula: `Opener → Value Prop → Social Proof (optional) → CTA`

```
Hey {{firstName}},

[OPENER]
Was searching for the top car dealerships in Tampa and came across
your website - you have some great reviews!

[VALUE PROP]
We can help you sell 20 more used cars each month with our Car Dealer
Lead System - or you don't pay.

[CTA]
Are you interested in learning more?
```

## SaaS Outreach

_Best for software products with a clear, quantifiable time or money benefit._

Formula: `Opening question hook → Clear value prop → Immediate benefit → "Reply yes" CTA`

```
[HOOK — Opening question]
{{firstName}}, if you suddenly had {{specificBenefit}}, how would you spend it?
Strategic growth? Deeper client relationships? Wrapping up work earlier?

[VALUE PROP — Product + integration]
My team and I built {{briefSolutionDescription}}. It {{specificFunctionality}},
integrates seamlessly with {{relevantSystem}}, and {{easeOfUseStatement}}.

[BENEFIT — Quantified outcome]
Our clients typically see {{specificResult}}, enabling them to reinvest that
into {{positiveOutcome}} — whether that's driving growth or simply having more downtime.

[CTA — Reply-only]
Just reply "yes," and I'll send over more info.

[CLOSE]
Either way, thanks for your time — I'll keep this short.
```

## AIDA

_Best when you can reference a specific achievement or recent activity._

Formula: `Achievement observation → Pain point → Competitor result → Meeting CTA`

```
Hi {{firstName}},

I noticed your team recently {{achievementOrActivity}}. A lot of {{industry}}
companies I speak with struggle with {{painPoint}} — it slows growth and eats time.

We've helped companies like {{competitor}} boost {{desiredOutcome}} by {{result}}.

Would you be open to a quick 15-min call to see if this could work
for {{companyName}} too?
```

## PAS

_Best when the prospect has a clear, known pain point you can name._

Formula: `Pain point → Agitation → Solution + Guarantee → CTA`

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Many {{industry}} companies run into challenges with {{specificPainPoint}}
— and it often slows down progress or blocks growth.

We help solve this by implementing a {{solutionType}} designed to consistently
deliver {{expectedOutcome}}.
{{guarantee}}

Would you be open to a quick call to explore if this could help {{companyName}}?
```

## BAB

_Best when you can paint a vivid contrast between current pain and future state._

Formula: `Current state → Imagine future state → Solution bridges gap → CTA`

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Right now, many {{industry}} companies are dealing with {{currentState}}
— and it can make {{desiredResult}} feel out of reach.

Imagine instead if {{futureState}} — all without {{painPoint}} or added complexity.

We help bridge that gap with a {{solutionType}} that delivers {{expectedOutcome}}.
You only pay {{paymentCondition}}, and setup can start as early as {{startTimeframe}}.

Would you be open to a quick call to see if this could fit your goals
at {{companyName}}?
```

## Straight to Value + Guarantee

_Best when you have a strong case study and a performance guarantee._

Formula: `Personalization → Similar company result → Guarantee → Specific time CTA`

```
Hey {{firstName}},

{{personalization}}

Just helped a business like {{companyName}} add {{result}} using our
{{solutionName}} — no {{painPoint1}}, no {{painPoint2}}, no {{painPoint3}}.

It's designed to bring in {{expectedOutcome}}, and if it doesn't deliver,
{{guarantee}}.

Would you be opposed to a quick 15-min chat?
I'm free tomorrow at {{timeOption1}} or {{timeOption2}}.

Just reply "yes", and I'll send over the invite.
```

## High-Ticket Outreach

_Best for done-for-you services with pay-on-results models._

Formula: `Provocative question → Solution + payment condition → Low friction CTA`

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Are you still manually handling {{painfulProcess}}?

We've built a {{solutionType}} that delivers {{expectedOutcome}}
— and you only pay {{paymentCondition}}.

No {{painPoint1}}, no {{painPoint2}}, and we can start as early
as {{startTimeframe}}.

Would you be opposed to see what that could look like for your business?
```

## Results-Driven

_Best for lead gen or appointment-setting services._

Formula: `Found company → Offer to send leads → Pay-per-result model → CTA`

```
Hello {{firstName}},

Found {{companyName}} while looking for businesses focused in {{customerIndustry}}.

Would you be open to me sending you businesses that need help
with {{problemTheySolve}}?

We find, engage, and deliver decision-makers from your target audience,
and you pay only for leads ready for meetings.

Something you'd be interested in?

P.S. I noticed {{testimonialOrFeedback}} — what's the next big growth challenge?
```

## Free Resource (Two-Step)

_Best for building trust first. Offer a lead magnet, then sell on the reply._

Formula: `Role acknowledgment → Lead magnet offer → Social proof P.S. → CTA`

**Step 1 — Initial email:**
```
Hi {{firstName}},

Saw you're the {{jobTitle}} at {{companyName}} — are you currently managing
your team's {{workRelatedToService}}?

I put together a {{leadMagnet}} tailored for companies in the {{industry}} space.
It's based on what's working right now to {{mainResult}} with {{theirTargetAudience}}.

Want me to send it over?

P.S. It helped {{similarCompany}} generate {{result}} last month
— figured it might be useful for {{companyName}} too.
```

**Step 2 — When they reply "yes":**
```
Awesome, {{firstName}} — here's the resource:
[Insert link]

It's plug-and-play, but if you want to go deeper — I'd be happy to walk you
through how our clients are using it to {{specificOutcome}}.

Here's my calendar if you'd like to chat: [Insert link]

Let me know what you think — happy to tailor it further for your niche.
```

## Feedback Request

_Best for early-stage offers that need market validation. Positions the sender as seeking input, not selling._

Formula: `New concept pitch → Ask for honest feedback → Offer to pay for time → CTA`

```
Hey {{firstName}},

I'm working on something new — a system that helps {{businessType}} like you
get booked calls with leads, but only pay if they show up.

Would love to get your honest feedback on the concept — especially if you've
had frustrations with {{problem}} lately.

Totally understand your time is valuable. If it helps, I'm happy to pay you
whatever you feel is fair for a quick call — even if it's above your usual rate.

Open to it?
```

## Quick Win

_Best for marketing/agency services where you can reference specific prospect content (ads, posts, campaigns)._

Formula: `Reference specific content → Credibility stat → Offer free audit → CTA`

```
Hey {{firstName}},

Just saw your {{prospectContent}} and had a few ideas that could help
improve results.

I've helped other {{industry}} teams increase conversions by up to
{{conversionResult}} — sometimes by tweaking just a few words in the
emails or ad flow.

Mind if I send you a short audit?

P.S. No strings — just sharing what I see. Could give you one or two
quick wins right away.
```

## Problem-Consequence-Solution

_Best when the pain point has clear downstream consequences you can name._

Formula: `Personalization → Painful process → Negative outcomes → Solution → CTA`

```
Hi {{firstName}},

{{personalization}}

Not sure if this applies to you — but many {{businessType}} I speak with
are stuck juggling {{painfulProcess}} across messy tools or unreliable contractors.

That often leads to {{negativeOutcome1}}, {{negativeOutcome2}}, and missed growth.

We fix that by installing a {{solutionType}} that delivers {{expectedOutcome}},
starting as early as {{startTimeframe}} — and you only pay {{paymentCondition}}.

Want me to send over a quick breakdown?
```

## Curiosity

_Best when you don't know the prospect's exact situation and want to open a conversation._

Formula: `Question about their process → "If you're aiming to..." → Done-for-you solution → CTA`

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Quick question — how are you currently handling {{painfulProcess}}
at {{companyName}}?

If you're aiming to {{desiredOutcome}} without {{painPoint1}} or {{painPoint2}},
I may have something useful.

We set up a done-for-you {{solutionType}} that brings in {{expectedOutcome}},
and you only pay {{paymentCondition}}.

No upfront fees — and we can start as early as {{startTimeframe}}.

Open to a quick 15-min chat?
```

## Video CTA

_Best for high-value prospects where a personalized touch differentiates you._

Formula: `Question about goal → Social proof names → Offer personalized video → CTA`

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Quick question — are you looking to {{desiredOutcome}} without {{painPoint1}},
{{painPoint2}}, or {{painPoint3}}?

At {{senderCompany}}, we help {{businessTypePlural}} book {{expectedOutcome}}
using a done-for-you {{solutionType}} — no fluff, no freelancers, no overwhelm.

{{targetAudience}} like {{clientName1}}, {{clientName2}} are now growing
predictably while staying lean and focused on what they do best.

If you're curious, I can send over a short, personalized video in the next
24 hours — completely free, no strings.

Want me to send it?
```
