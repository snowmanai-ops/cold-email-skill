We can help you build your authority by getting you on 5 podcasts a month in the coaching space.

[VALUE ADD — Bonus service detail]
After the podcast, we'll take the footage and clip it up into short videos for Instagram and TikTok - and post the clips for you.

## Angle Construction Patterns

Each example demonstrates these reusable patterns:

1. **Opener types**: Discovery search, personal connection/referral, credibility observation
2. **Value prop specificity**: Always include a number (50 patients, 5 podcasts, 23% increase)
3. **Guarantee structures**: "or you don't pay", "if we don't deliver X, you don't pay us"
4. **Case study relevance**: Match industry (doctor → other practices), prestige (jewelry → Tiffany & Co), or location (Tampa → Tampa businesses)
5. **CTA softness**: Always a question, never a demand
