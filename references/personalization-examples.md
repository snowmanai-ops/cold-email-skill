## Strategy Overview

AI-generated first lines are a thing of the past. Instead, mass personalize at scale by creating **multiple opener variations** per ICP segment. Each variation uses `{{company.name}}` or `{{companyName}}` tokens but has a different narrative frame. Distribute variations evenly across your lead list so no two prospects in the same circle receive identical emails.

## Scenario 1: Women's Jewelry eCommerce

**Variation A:**
"Was doing some shopping for my aunt's 50th birthday and came across {{company.name}}'s website."

**Variation B:**
"My girlfriend recently bought a few items from {{company.name}}'s store and she can't stop talking about them - keep up the great work!"

**Variation C:**
"A few of my friends have told me how high-quality {{company.name}}'s necklaces are - really impressed by your brand."

**Variation D:**
"Was scrolling through my Instagram feed and was targeted with one of {{company.name}}'s ads."

**Variation E:**
"Checked out {{company.name}}'s website the other day while shopping for my wedding anniversary, and was hit with one of your ads today."

## Scenario 2: Local Plumbers

**Variation A:**
"Recently moved to Tampa and came across {{company.name}}'s website looking for a new plumber."

**Variation B:**
"Was searching for top rated plumbers in Tampa Bay and came across {{company.name}}'s website - impressed by your reviews."

## Scenario 3: Restaurants

**Variation A:**
"Was looking for a restaurant for my 10th wedding anniversary, and came across {{CompanyName}} on Yelp - you have an amazing menu!"

**Variation B:**
"Being from Los Angeles, I can't believe I've never heard of {{CompanyName}} - your dishes look delicious!"

## Scenario 4: Software Company CEOs

**Variation A:**
"As the CEO of {{CompanyName}}, I imagine you're looking for more qualified leads each month to fill your sales team's calendars."

**Variation B:**
"As the CEO of {{CompanyName}}, I imagine you're looking for more experienced salespeople."

## Scenario 5: Marketing Leaders at Startups

**Variation A:**
"As someone involved with marketing at {{CompanyName}}, I imagine you're looking for more ways to promote your products."

**Variation B:**
