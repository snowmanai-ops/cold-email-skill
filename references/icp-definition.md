## What is an ICP

An Ideal Client Profile is a well-defined understanding of the perfect **company** AND the **decision maker** (person) at that company. Both must be clearly defined before writing any cold emails.

## Company Filtering Mechanisms

Use these filters to narrow down ideal companies:

- **Location** — City, state, country
- **Company size** — Small, mid-market, enterprise
- **Employee count** — Specific ranges (e.g., 10-50, 50-200)
- **Estimated revenue** — Annual revenue brackets
- **Industry** — Vertical/niche
- **Keywords** — Terms used in their space (job postings, website copy)
- **Technologies** — Tools they use that your product enhances or replaces
- **Funding history** — Recent rounds, total raised
- **Job postings** — Hiring for roles related to your offer (signals active need)

## People Filtering Mechanisms

Use these filters to identify the right decision makers:

- **Location** — Where the person is based
- **Job Titles** — CEO, CMO, Head of Marketing, Founder, VP of Sales, etc.

## How to Define Your ICP

### Research Strategies

1. **Build a "Dream 100" list** — List the 100 companies you'd most want as clients. Look for patterns across industry, size, location, and technology.
2. **Tap into your personal brand** — Connect with industry experts who can point you toward ideal prospects.
3. **Conduct market research in niche groups** — Join Facebook groups, Slack communities, Reddit threads, and LinkedIn groups where your ideal clients congregate.

### Key Questions to Answer

- What industry are your ideal clients in?
- Where are they located?
- What is their company size (employees, revenue)?
- What technologies are they using that your product could enhance or replace?
- Are they hiring for positions related to your offer?
- Who are the decision makers (titles, seniority)?

## Building a Lead List
