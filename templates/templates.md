## SAAS outreach

**Opening Question / Hook:**

{{FirstName}}, if you suddenly had {{SpecificBenefit or Result}}, how would you spend it? Strategic growth? Deeper client relationships? Wrapping up work earlier?

**Clear & Simple Value Proposition:**

My team and I built {{BriefSolutionDescription}}. It {{SpecificFunctionality}}, integrates seamlessly with {{RelevantSystem or Process}}, and {{EaseOfUseStatement}}.

**Immediate Benefit & Outcome:**

Our clients typically see {{SpecificBenefit or Result}}, enabling them to reinvest that into {{PositiveOutcome or Benefit}}—whether that’s driving growth or simply having more downtime.

**Direct Call-to-Action (CTA):**

Just reply “yes,” and I’ll send over more info.

**Close:**

Either way, thanks for your time—I’ll keep this short.

## AIDA - attention interest desire action

```markdown
Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed your team recently {{achievement_or_activity}}. A lot of {{industry}} companies I speak with struggle with {{pain_point}} — it slows growth and eats time.

We’ve helped companies like {{Competitor}} boost {{desired outcome}} by {{result}}.

Would you be open to a quick 15-min call to see if this could work for {{company_name}} too?

Best,  
{{sender_name}}  
{{sender_company}}

**If it's not relevant right now, just reply "stop" and I’ll leave it there.**
```

## PAS - problem, agitate, solve

```markdown
Hi {{First_Name}},

Many {{industry}} companies run into challenges with {{specific_pain_point}} — and it often slows down progress or blocks growth.

We help solve this by implementing a {{solution_type}} designed to consistently deliver {{expected_outcome}}.  
{{guarantee}}
Would you be open to a quick call to explore if this could help {{company_name}}?

Best,  
{{sender_name}}  
{{sender_company}}

**Not the right time? Just say “stop” and I won’t reach out again.**
```

## BAB - before after bridge

```markdown
Hi {{first_name}},

Right now, many {{industry}} companies are dealing with {{current_state}} — and it can make {{desired_result}} feel out of reach.

Imagine instead if {{future_state}} — all without {{pain_point}} or added complexity.

We help bridge that gap with a {{solution_type}} that delivers {{expected_outcome}}.  
You only pay {{payment_condition}}, and setup can start as early as {{start_timeframe}}.

Would you be open to a quick call to see if this could fit your goals at {{company_name}}?

Best,  
{{sender_name}}  
{{sender_company}}

**If this isn’t useful, reply “stop” and I’ll make sure you’re not contacted again.**
```

## ✅ Straight to value + guarantee

```markdown
Hey {{first_name}},

{{personalization}}

Just helped a business like {{company_name}} add {{result}} using our {{solution_name}} — no {{pain_point_1}}, no {{pain_point_2}}, no {{pain_point_3}}.

It’s designed to bring in {{expected_outcome}}, and if it doesn’t deliver, {{guarantee}}.

Would you be opposed to a quick 15-min chat?  
I’m free tomorrow at {{time_option_1}} or {{time_option_2}}.

Just reply “yes”, and I’ll send over the invite.

Best,  
{{sender_name}}  
{{sender_company}}

If it's not relevant right now, just reply "stop" and I’ll leave it there.
```

## 🧠 **High-Ticket Outreach System**

```markdown
Hi {{first_name}},

Are you still manually handling {{painful_process}}?

We’ve built a {{solution_type}} that delivers {{expected_outcome}} — and you only pay {{payment_condition}}.

No {{pain_point_1}}, no {{pain_point_2}}, and we can start as early as {{start_timeframe}}.

Would you be opposed to see what that could look like for your business?

Best,  
{{sender_name}}  
{{sender_company}}

**Not the right time? Just say “stop” and I won’t reach out again.**
```

## 📈 Results-Driven

```markdown
Hello {{firstName}},

Found {{CompanyName}} while looking for businesses focused in {{customerIndustry}}.

Would you be open to me sending you businesses that need help with {{problemTheySolve}}?

We find, engage, and deliver decision-makers from your target audience, and you pay only for leads ready for meetings.

Something you’d be interested in?

{{sender_name}}  
{{sender_company}}

P.S. I noticed {testimonial or customerFeedback}}, what’s the next big growth challenge?

Say “stop” if you’d rather I not bother you.
```

## 📬 **Free Resource CTA**

```markdown
Hi {firstName},

Saw you’re the {jobTitle} at {companyName} — are you currently managing your team’s {{workRelatedToServiceOffered}?

I put together a {{LeadMagnet}} tailored for companies in the {industry} space. It’s based on what’s working right now to {{MainResult}} with {theirTargetAudience}.

Want me to send it over?

{{sender_name}}  
{{sender_company}}

P.S. It helped {SimilarCompany} generate {Result} last month — figured it might be useful for {companyName} too.

Not the right time? Just say “stop” and I won’t reach out again.

---------------------------------

Awesome, {firstName} — here’s the script I put together:
👉 [Insert Google Doc / PDF link or paste directly]

It’s plug-and-play, but if you want to go deeper:

I’d be happy to walk you through how our clients are using it to book 50+ meetings/month while avoiding spam filters and skipping SDR hiring.

Here’s my link if you'd like to chat:

```markdown
Subject: Can I get your opinion on this?

Hey {firstName},

I’m working on something new — a system that helps {businessType} like you get booked calls with leads, but only pay if they show up.

Would love to get your honest feedback on the concept — especially if you've had frustrations with {problem} lately.

Totally understand your time is valuable. If it helps, I’m happy to pay you whatever you feel is fair for a quick call — even if it’s above your usual rate.

Open to it?

Dorde
```

```markdown
Subject: Quick win for your next campaign?

Hey {firstName},

Just saw your {FB ad / LinkedIn campaign / recent post} and had a few ideas that could help improve results.

I’ve helped other {industry} teams increase conversions by up to 260% — sometimes by tweaking just a few words in the emails or ad flow.

Mind if I send you a short audit?

P.S. No strings — just sharing what I see. Could give you one or two quick wins right away.

## Problem-consequence-solution-CTA

```markdown
Hi {{first_name}},

{{Personalization}}

Not sure if this applies to you — but many {{business_type}} I speak with are stuck juggling {{painful_process}} across messy tools or unreliable contractors.

That often leads to {{negative_outcome_1}}, {{negative_outcome_2}}, and missed growth.

We fix that by installing a {{solution_type}} that delivers {{expected_outcome}}, starting as early as {{start_timeframe}} — and you only pay {{payment_condition}}.

Want me to send over a quick breakdown?

Best,  
{{sender_name}}  
{{sender_company}}

If it's not relevant right now, just reply "stop" and I’ll leave it there.
```

## **🧐 Curiosity**

```markdown
Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question — how are you currently handling {{painful_process}} at {{company_name}}?

If you’re aiming to {{desired_outcome}} without {{pain_point_1}} or {{pain_point_2}}, I may have something useful.

We set up a done-for-you {{solution_type}} that brings in {{expected_outcome}}, and you only pay {{payment_condition}}.

No upfront fees — and we can start as early as {{start_timeframe}}.

Open to a quick 15-min chat?

Best,  
{{sender_name}}  
{{sender_company}}

**Not the right time? Just say “stop” and I won’t reach out again.**
```

## 🎥 **Video CTA – How We’re Different**

```markdown
Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question — are you looking to {{desired_outcome}} without {{pain_point_1}}, {{pain_point_2}}, or {{pain_point_3}}?

At {{sender_company}}, we help {{business_type_plural}} book {{expected_outcome}} using a done-for-you {{solution_type}} — no fluff, no freelancers, no overwhelm.

{{targetAudience}} like [Coach A, Coach B] are now growing predictably while staying lean and focused on what they do best.

If you're curious, I can send over a short, personalized video in the next 24 hours — completely free, no strings.

Want me to send it?

Hi `First name`

I reached out the other day to talk about how I can help `company` get `outcome` using `our solution`

Here are some of the results I’ve generated for other `company type:` 

- `Result customer 1`

- `Result customer 3`

When is a good time to have a quick chat?

Best Regards,

Follow Up ****- Break Up

Hi `First name`

I haven’t heard back from you, so I’m going to assume you’re not interested in `Desired outcome`

Let me know if this changes anytime soon.

Best Regards,

`Your name`

PS: If it’s not relevant, just  let me know and I will not contact you again.
