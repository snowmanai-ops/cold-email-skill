# Cold Email

Write cold emails that get replies. This skill covers the full pipeline from defining your Ideal Client Profile through writing complete email sequences with follow-ups.

## Email Structure Formula

Every cold email follows this structure:

```
Opener → Value Proposition → Social Proof (optional) → CTA
```

**Canonical example:**

```
Hey Christian,

[OPENER]
Was searching for the top car dealerships in Tampa and came across
your website - you have some great reviews!

[VALUE PROP]
We can help you sell 20 more used cars each month with our Car Dealer
Lead System - or you don't pay.

[CTA]
Are you interested in learning more?
```

This email demonstrates all three rules below: 2:1 ratio (5 "you's" to 2 "we's"), under 50 words, and feels personalized via the research-based opener.

## The Three Rules

### Rule 1: The 2:1 Rule

Mention the prospect at least 2x more than yourself. Count "you/your/you're" vs "I/we/my/our" — aim for at least a 2:1 ratio.

**Anti-pattern:** Never write "I would love to" — this is the worst phrasing in cold email. It centers the sender, not the prospect.

### Rule 2: The 50 Word Rule

Keep cold emails under 50 words. Brevity increases response rates. Every word must earn its place.

### Rule 3: Mass Personalization

Emails must *feel* personalized but actually be templated for scale. The strategy:

- Create 2-5 opener variations per ICP segment
- Each variation uses personalization tokens but has a different narrative frame
- Distribute variations evenly across the lead list (e.g., 3 variations → ~33% each)
- This avoids AI detection and feels genuinely personal

Common tokens: `{{firstName}}`, `{{companyName}}`, `{{company.name}}`

Ask the user what token format their email platform uses if unclear.

For detailed niche-specific examples with multiple variations, see [references/personalization-examples.md](references/personalization-examples.md).

## Email Frameworks

Choose a framework based on the offer type and what you know about the prospect. When the user doesn't specify, default to **Standard** for simple offers or **Straight to Value** for offers with a performance guarantee.

For complete templates with token placeholders, see [references/email-frameworks.md](references/email-frameworks.md).

| Framework | Best for |
|-----------|----------|
| **Standard** | Most cold emails — simple, direct, proven |
| **SaaS Outreach** | Software products with quantifiable time/money benefit |
| **AIDA** | When you can reference a specific achievement or recent activity |
| **PAS** | When the prospect has a clear, known pain point |
| **BAB** | When you can paint a vivid before/after contrast |
| **Straight to Value + Guarantee** | Strong case study + performance guarantee |
| **High-Ticket Outreach** | Done-for-you services with pay-on-results models |
| **Results-Driven** | Lead gen or appointment-setting services |
| **Free Resource (Two-Step)** | Building trust first — offer a lead magnet, sell on the reply |
| **Feedback Request** | Early-stage offers needing market validation |
| **Quick Win** | Marketing/agency — reference specific prospect content |
| **Problem-Consequence-Solution** | Pain point with clear downstream consequences |
| **Curiosity** | Unknown prospect situation — open a conversation |
| **Video CTA** | High-value prospects — personalized touch |

## Subject Lines

Goal: Sell the open and pique curiosity. Keep them short. Don't overthink testing — pick ones that feel natural and rotate through them.

**Curiosity / Casual:**
1. `Quick question`
2. `Quick question {{firstName}}`
3. `Thoughts, {{firstName}}?`
4. `Is that true {{firstName}}?`
5. `Why not {{firstName}}?`
6. `Would this help?`
7. `Hey got a sec?`
8. `quick heads up`
9. `super quick`
10. `How about this?`
11. `do you mind {{firstName}}`
12. `I was wondering {{firstName}}...`
13. `possible partnership?`
14. `Meet {{caseStudyFirstName}}`

**Company-specific:**
15. `{{firstName}} <> {{senderFirstName}}`
16. `{{companyName}} <> [Your Company] - Intro`
17. `{{firstName}} // [Your Name] - Intro`
18. `Question about {{companyName}}`
19. `Regarding {{companyName}}`
20. `Saw this about {{companyName}}...`
21. `Increased conversions for {{companyName}}`
22. `More sales calls for {{companyName}}`
23. `[Specific result] or you don't pay`
24. `[Percentage] more [outcome], guaranteed`

## Email Openers

Goals: Sell the open, show the prospect it's personalized (even though it isn't), make it relevant to them.

**Pattern 1 — Discovery:**
"Was searching for the top [niche] in [location] and came across {{companyName}}'s website - you have some great reviews!"

**Pattern 2 — Shopping/Browsing:**
"Was doing some shopping for [occasion] and came across {{companyName}}'s website - love the products!"

**Pattern 3 — Assumed Need:**
"As the [title] of a [business type], I bet you're always looking to [goal relevant to your offer]."

**Pattern 4 — Key Player:**
"Noticed you're a key player at {{companyName}} - I imagine you're looking for ways to [goal relevant to your offer]."

Each pattern can be adapted per niche. For 5 fully worked scenarios with multiple variations each, see [references/personalization-examples.md](references/personalization-examples.md).

## Case Study Integration

Add social proof to strengthen the pitch. Three integration patterns:

**Pattern 1 — Integrated (after value prop):**
```
[Opener] + [Value prop] +
"Our system recently helped [similar company] [specific result] -
and we can help you do the same." + [CTA]
```

**Pattern 2 — Quantified results (replaces value prop):**
```
[Opener] +
"Just reaching out because [system] recently helped [company]
[specific metric, e.g., 'sell an extra 33% more used cars in January']." +
"Open to learning how we can help you do the same?"
```

**Pattern 3 — Direct lead-in (best for follow-ups):**
```
"The reason for my email is because we just helped [company] [result],
and we can help you do the same." +
[Expanded value prop] + [CTA]
```

**Case study tips:**
- Match the prospect's industry, location, or company size
- Always include specific numbers (33% increase, 60 extra units, 9x ROI)
- Use recent timeframes ("in January", "in their first 3 weeks")

## Call-To-Actions (CTAs)

Goals: Sell the reply (not the meeting), give clear next steps, keep it conversational.

The ONLY goal of a CTA is to get someone to reply.

**Examples (low friction → higher friction):**
1. "Are you interested in learning more?"
2. "Open to discussing further?"
3. "Is this something you'd be interested in?"
4. "Mind if I share more info?"
5. "Are you open to a quick call to discuss this further?"
6. "When works for a 12 minute call to discuss?"
7. "Any interest in connecting for a call to learn more?"

Use low-friction language: "mind if", "open to", "interested in". Always phrase as a question.

## Follow-Up Cadence

Structure a 5-email sequence with this timing:

| Email | Day | Strategy |
|-------|-----|----------|
| #1 | 0 | A/B/C split — each variation to ~33% of list |
| #2 | +4 | Re-state value prop + add case study |
| #3 | +7 | Provide something tangible or redirect ("who's the best person to discuss...") |
| #4 | +12 | Pattern interrupt — spy emoji only: 🕵️ |
| #5 | +33 | Soft re-engagement: "Would now be a better time to discuss..." |

**Key principles:**
- Split Email #1 into 2-3 variations (A/B/C test)
- Each follow-up re-frames the value prop — never just "checking in"
- Email #4 spy emoji is a deliberate pattern interrupt that triggers curiosity
- Email #5 uses a long gap then soft re-open with "your communication would be appreciated either way"
